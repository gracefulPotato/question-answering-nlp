"A Lion watched a fat Bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered when he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare to attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns.
Hunger, however, presently compelled him to do something: and as the use of force did not promise success, he determined to resort to artifice.
Going up to the Bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, ""I cannot help saying how much I admire your magnificent figure.  What a fine head!  What powerful shoulders and thighs!  But, my dear friend, what in the world makes you wear those ugly horns?  You must find them as awkward as they are unsightly.  Believe me, you would do much better without them.""

Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, ""What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."" 
The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, ""You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits.""",fables-01-6

Today was a very eventful work day. Today was the start of the G20 summit. It happens every year and it is where 20 of the leaders of the world come together to talk about how to run their governments effectively and what not. Since there are so many leaders coming together their are going to be a lot of people who have different views on how to run the government they follow so they protest. There was a protest that happened along the street where I work and at first it looked peaceful until a bunch of people started rebelling and creating a riot. Police cars were burned and things were thrown at cops. Police were in full riot gear to alleviate the violence. As things got worse tear gas and bean bag bullets were fired at the rioters while they smash windows of stores. And this all happened right in front of my store which was kind of scary but it was kind of interesting since I've never seen a riot before.,blogs-01-6

"Alyssa got to the beach after a long trip. She's from Charlotte. She traveled from Atlanta. She's now in Miami. She went to Miami to visit some friends. But she wanted some time to herself at the beach, so she went there first. After going swimming and laying out, she went to her friend Ellen's house. Ellen greeted Alyssa and they both had some lemonade to drink. Alyssa called her friends Kristin and Rachel to meet at Ellen's house. The girls traded stories and caught up on their lives. It was a happy time for everyone. The girls went to a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant had a special on catfish. Alyssa enjoyed the restaurant's special. Ellen ordered a salad. Kristin had soup. Rachel had a steak. After eating, the ladies went back to Ellen's house to have fun. They had lots of fun. They stayed the night because they were tired. Alyssa was happy to spend time with her friends again.
