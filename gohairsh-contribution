Team name: Team Mango Persimmon

Team's approach:
We took a somewhat empirical approach, trying various strategies and keeping what worked.
We began by trying to match keywords in the story, then tried finding the sentences of the 
story that were most similar to the question, then filtered these by the constituents
the question was asking for.

What each team member did:
Kathryn Rosengrant (Katie) wrote the code to find the most relevant sentence in the story 
based on the question and another function to compare the matches to find which was best. 
She also worked on different question types.
I worked on the discourse model and pronoun resolution, finding out what kind of constituent
a question is asking for, and extending our solution to use Scheherazade.

My contribution:
I contributed a function to determine what kind of constituent a question wants in answer.
I wrote the code to create the discourse model and to use that model for pronoun resolution. 
I also extended Katie's code for determining the most relevant sentence of the story based 
on the question so that it was used on the Scheherazade parse as well, then kept the better 
of the two sentences (from the straight-up story and from Scheherazade), again using a helper 
function that Katie wrote.
