{'A few years ago, a young man died out on my front lawn when he crashed his motorbike.': 0, 'I was with him in his last moments but there was\nnothing I could do because he was badly injured with a broken neck.': 0, 'Later, when I was visiting the place where he died, I decided to talk to him as if he were still there because I wanted him to know how bad I felt that I couldnt help him.': 0, 'And I know this sounds crazy, but I saw this ball of light in the trees above me.': 0, 'At first, my logical mind thought that it was my brother playing around with his new flashlight (not at all like it, but the closest thing I could imagine)\nAnd when I went inside the house, everyone was snoring!': 5, 'Lol could this have been what they call an orb \nPS.': 0, 'Not the first weird experience ive had.': 0}
EASY best sentence: At first, my logical mind thought that it was my brother playing around with his new flashlight (not at all like it, but the closest thing I could imagine)
And when I went inside the house, everyone was snoring!
